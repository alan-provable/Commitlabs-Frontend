/**
 * GET /api/protocol/constants
 *
 * Returns the public protocol constants used by UX copy and calculations,
 * including fee parameters, penalty tiers, and commitment limits.
 *
 * This endpoint is public (no authentication required) because all returned
 * values are non-sensitive protocol parameters.
 *
 * Caching guidance:
 *  - The response includes a `cachedAt` timestamp so clients can tell how
 *    fresh the data is.
 *  - A `Cache-Control` header is set to allow browsers / CDNs to cache the
 *    response for up to 5 minutes, with a stale-while-revalidate window of
 *    60 seconds.
 *  - Server-side, the constants are cached in-memory for the lifetime of
 *    the process (see `getProtocolConstants()`).
